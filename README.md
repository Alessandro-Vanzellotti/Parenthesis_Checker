# Parenthesis_Checker
#This repository is of an algorithm that decides if a string is correct or incorrect depending on the pattern of N number of parenthesis; 
#The language used was python;


#Directives: 
1.The algorithm checks if all the opening parenthesis have their matching closing one as well as if the closing ones are preceded by an opening one; 
2.Considering this pattern is followed and consequently the number of opening and closing parenthesis are even, the string(s) is/are correct. Otherwise, the string(s) is/are deemed incorrect;
3.Moreover, this repository contains a separate file for testing in which it is possible to generate any number of lines consisting of 1.000 randomly generated characters, including both types of parenthesis;

#Main goal: to iterate through an array of 10.000 strings under 1 second of run time.
